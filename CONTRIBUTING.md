# Contribution Guidelines
Please note that this is a personal project of mine and is currently only designed for use in a handful of servers at most. I do not currently plan nor wish for it to be used in many servers or become a large bot.

The following rules apply when contributing to this repository:
- Do not open a pull request that adds major features without prior discussion through GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/FloatingMilkshake/MechanicalMilkshake/issues) feature or other means. 
- Do not attempt to implement sharding. This is not necessary as this bot is only made for use in a few servers at most. 
- Do not propose any significant changes without prior testing. I will not accept untested changes.
- Do not alter the GitHub Actions files (`/.github/workflows`) or Docker configuration files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) without prior discussion. Open an issue if there is a problem.

Note that I do not expect this bot to be perfect by any means. Please be respectful when submitting changes, especially those that make optimizations. Please do not try to complicate anything to comply with 'best practices', as again I do not expect this bot to be perfect. I know I am certainly not the best at this, and that there are most likely better ways to do the things I'm doing, and that's fine.

If I cannot understand the code you are contributing, it will be rejected. One of my major goals for this project is to learn about bot development, and having someone propose changes with code I cannot understand is a big no. If you'd like to discuss big changes and are able to explain them, that's fine, but if you just propose big changes and I'm not sure what they are then I probably won't accept them.

Additionally, this repository is not part of Hacktoberfest; please do not make any contributions expecting points, rewards, etc. I respect Hacktoberfest but do not wish to take part in it with this project.
